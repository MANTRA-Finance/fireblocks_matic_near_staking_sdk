## Customer Staker
If you (for some reason) require to generate your own staker (for a non-supported Blockchain, or other internal purposes), you are able to create it and have the same functionality.<br>
To do this, you can see the example in the [customStaker.js](./customStaker.js) or [customerStaker.ts](./customStaker.ts).
